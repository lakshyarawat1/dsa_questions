# Collections

- Collections in java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.

- Java Collection means a single unit of objects. Java Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque) and classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).

## What is a collection in Java ?

- In Java, a collection is an object that groups multiple elements into a single unit.

- Collections are used to store, retrieve, manipulate, and communicate aggregate data.

## What is a framework in java ?

- A framework is a set of classes and interfaces which provide a ready-made architecture.

- Frameworks are used to create applications and they hide the low-level details from you.

- In other words, frameworks provide a standard way to build and deploy applications.


## What is collection framework ?

- A collection framework is a unified architecture or a set of interfaces and classes which provide an efficient way to store, retrieve, manipulate and communicate with a group of objects.

- It provides the developers with following advantages:

    - Reduces programming effort: By providing useful data structures and algorithms, the collection framework frees you to concentrate on the important parts of your program rather than on the low-level "plumbing" required to make it work.

    - Increases program speed and quality: The collection framework provides high-performance, high-quality implementations of useful data structures and algorithms. The various implementations of each interface are interchangeable, so programs can be easily tuned by switching collection implementations.

### Hierarchy of Collections Framework

- The collections framework includes the following:

    - Interfaces: These are abstract data types that represent collections. Interfaces allow collections to be manipulated independently of the details of their representation. In object-oriented languages, interfaces generally form a hierarchy.

    - Implementations: These are the concrete implementations of the collection interfaces. In essence, they are reusable data structures.

    - Algorithms: These are the methods that perform useful computations, such as searching and sorting, on objects that implement collection interfaces. The algorithms are said to be polymorphic: that is, the same method can be used on many different implementations of the appropriate collection interface. In essence, algorithms are reusable functionality.
